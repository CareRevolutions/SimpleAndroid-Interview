# Instructions
test
This is a simple Android app that downloads a list of states and displays them in a ListView. It should take about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete the following tasks.

**NOTE:** Steps are broken down into tasks that should take around 10 - 20 minutes. If you find yourself taking a lot more than the estimated time, please move on to the next step and note where you ran into any problems.

1. Make sure you can run this app in Android Studio on an emulator.

2. Inspect the code and note places where you'd make improvements based on Android best practices.

3. Modify the app to use Android Architecture Components, specifically:

4. Add a ViewModel that downloads the list of states.

5. Expose the list of states using LiveData.

6. Bind the LiveData of states to the ListView adapter.

7. Bonus (optional): Modify the app in some way, visually or internally, that you think might be useful or cool.

In the interview, we'll discuss this app, ways to improve it, architectural concepts, best practices and what ideas you think are important in making a strong, reliable and easy to use Android app.

**FINAL NOTE:** Be prepared to run Android Studio, an emulator and share your screen during the interview.
