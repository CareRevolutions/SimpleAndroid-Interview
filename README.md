# Instructions

This is a simple Android app that downloads a list of states and displays them in a ListView. It should take about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete the following tasks.

**NOTE:** Steps are broken down into tasks that should take around 10 - 20 minutes. If you find yourself taking a lot more than the estimated time, please move on to the next step and note where you ran into any problems.

1. Make sure you can run this app in Android Studio on an emulator.

2. Inspect the code and note places where you'd make improvements based on Android best practices.

3. Modify the app to use Android Architecture Components, specifically:

4. Using the provided ViewModel write the code that downloads a list of states. 

5. Bind the states data emitted by the API with a vertical scrollable view (either in compose or in views)

6. Bonus (optional): Modify the app in some way, visually or internally, that you think might be useful or cool.

In the interview, we'll discuss this app, ways to improve it, architectural concepts, best practices and what ideas you think are important in making a strong, reliable and easy to use Android app.
